# User Stories

Reference the Writing User Stories final project guide in the course portal for more information about how to complete each of the sections below.

## Outline User Roles

1. Basic User
   - This is the general user who wants to track movies they plan to watch and manage their watchlist. They have access to adding movies, marking them as watched, and viewing their list.

2. Admin
   - An admin can manage the preset movie table, curate movie selections, and handle data consistency for the movie database.

## Draft User Stories

1. As a Basic User, I want to browse a list of preset movies, so that I can quickly add movies I want to watch to my watchlist.

2. As a Basic User, I want to search for movies online and add them to my list, so that I can track movies that are not in the preset table.

3. As a Basic User, I want to mark movies as "watched," so that I can track my viewing progress and avoid rewatching the same films.

4. As a Basic User, I want to filter my watchlist by "watched" and "unwatched" status, so that I can easily manage what I still need to watch.

5. As a Basic User, I want to remove movies from my watchlist, so that I can keep my list up to date.

6. As a Basic User, I want to edit the details of a movie in my watchlist (such as its name or release date), so that I can correct any mistakes or updates.

7. As a Basic User, I want my watchlist data to persist between sessions, so that I don't lose track of my progress when I log out.

8. As a Basic User, I want to create custom tags or categories for my movies, so that I can better organize my watchlist based on personal preferences (e.g., by genre or interest).

9. As a Basic User, I want to view a summary of how many movies Iâ€™ve watched and how many are left, so that I can track my overall progress.

10. As an Admin, I want to manage the preset movie table by adding, updating, or removing movie entries, so that the movie database remains relevant and accurate for all users.
