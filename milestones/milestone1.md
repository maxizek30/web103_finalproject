## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

The in-class demo for this unit went well, and the presentation was very helpful in understanding data relationships. The guides for completing each milestone were also extremely helpful.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Our group faced several challenges, the first being deciding on the complexity of the app. Initially, we had a more ambitious idea, but ultimately we opted for a simpler version to ensure we could deliver all core features and leave room for future improvements. Another challenge was communication, as we each had different priorities and schedules, which made it difficult to get started.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We think having the labs serve as examples for our project has been really helpful, and it would be great if we could continue doing that. It would also be beneficial if we had time during the labs to discuss our projects, since we all have different schedules.
