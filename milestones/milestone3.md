## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

What went well was the project management that we got to do. Putting our issues into a kanban board allowed us to stay focused and split up work well.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We ran into a bug with Railway while trying to set up the server, which we still have not solved, so we are currently using hardcoded data on the frontend side. We plan to solve this in the next sprint.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

Yes, we did finish all the tasks we had for this week.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

We would consider no features “at risk” and will probably end up adding new features.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

No additional support is needed except for what you guys have already been doing.
