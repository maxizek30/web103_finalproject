## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

One thing that went well was having a clear vision of our goals, which made dividing tasks straightforward. Knowing the desired features helped us delegate work effectively.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

One challenge we faced was maintaining consistency individually and avoiding last-minute work. After our weekly meetings, it was sometimes easy to lose track of tasks and underestimate the time needed, especially with everyone’s busy schedules.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Since these units have been conceptual and no code has been written yet, keeping up hasn't been challenging. However, as we move into implementation, having clear, reasonable timeframes for milestones—like we've been given in the past—will be very helpful in supporting our progress.
