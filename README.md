## About

### Description and Purpose

MovieTrackr is a simple movie tracking app that lets users manage their movie watchlist. It provides a preset table of movies to explore and allows users to add their own selections from the web. Users can mark movies as "watched" and track their progress. This app is designed for movie lovers who want a streamlined way to keep track of films they plan to see, without the distraction of ratings and reviews.

### Inspiration

The app is inspired by platforms like Letterboxd, where users can maintain a watchlist of movies. However, MovieTrackr simplifies the experience by removing ratings, reviews, and social features to focus solely on tracking movies. It's for users who prefer a minimalistic way of managing their movie lists.

## Tech Stack

Frontend:

- React.js and Vite for building interactive UI components.
- Axios for API requests to fetch movies

Backend:

- Node.js with Express for server-side logic.
- Railway Postgres SQL for storing user data, including movies and watchlist status.
- RESTful API to handle user data between sessions.

## Features

### Preset Movie Table âœ…

A curated list of preloaded movies that users can browse and add to their watchlist.

### Watchlist Tracking âœ…

Users can manage their watchlists in detail:

- View, add, and remove movies they want to watch.
- Mark movies as "watched" and keep track of their progress.
- The app saves and syncs this data between sessions, allowing users to continue from where they left off.
